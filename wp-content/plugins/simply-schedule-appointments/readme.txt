= Flexible, Fast, and Powerful Booking Calendars =

Other appointment scheduling plugins are either too simple or too complicated. They lack the basic features you need and want to start booking, or, if they do have those features, as you grow and add services, staff, and locations, they become complex and confusing to use for booking.

Simply Schedule Appointments is ready to grow with your business' booking needs — without all the confusion and clutter of settings that don't apply to you. It's also highly compatible with WordPress and can be added to any theme and page layout on your site.

Simply Schedule Appointments offers fully responsive booking calendars and works efficiently on any device – even touch screens. Our WordPress booking plugin will work dependably and reliably, whether you're managing your appointment availability from your tablet or your customer is booking an appointment from their smartphone.

= User-Friendly and Accessible Booking System =

Our WordPress booking calendar system was designed with people in mind, first and foremost. So we're always thinking about how people will be using our appointment scheduling plugin, what they'll expect, and what booking features they'll want and need.

This WordPress booking calendar system is built with you and your customer in mind and is accessible for everyone. We believe appointment scheduling should be as clear and straightforward as possible while maintaining the flexibility and booking features our customers need.

We've made sure that everyone can use our appointment scheduling plugin, including people with auditory, visual, and physical disabilities.

Everyone deserves access to everything the web offers, so we built our WordPress booking calendar plugin with accessibility in mind. As a result, you'll never have to worry that a customer will find themselves unable to schedule an appointment because of their abilities or the device they're using.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I show the booking form? =

To embed the Simply Schedule Appointments booking calendars on your WordPress pages or posts you can use a shortcode or a page builder module (ex. Elementor Appointment Booking module). You can paste the booking shortcode below using a text box to display all of your appointment types:

`[ssa_booking]`

= Where can I read the documentation? =

The full documentation is available at [our website](https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/help-center/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=help-center).
Or, get started with our [free Basic Edition guide](https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/guides/basic-edition-guide/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=basic-edition-guide).

= Will I end up being double-booked? =

Nope. Once a customer has booked an appointment time, that time is no longer available for booking. So you'll never find yourself double-booked.

Additionally, we do some extra checks while a customer is booking an appointment just to be sure their selected time is still available. If someone else books their selected time while they're in the process of booking, we'll let them know and ask them to select another time.

We also offer [Google Calendar syncing in our Plus, Pro, or Business Edition](https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/guides/syncing-google-calendar/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=google-calendar) to make sure you never double-book appointments with your personal schedule.

= Can I customize the appearance of the booking form? =

Yes, you can. We offer settings for color and font that will let you customize the form to blend seamlessly into any theme.

[You can additionally add custom CSS to customize the form even further](https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/guides/helpful-customization-guides/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=css-customize).

= Are there limitations on the number of booking calendars or appointments I can make? =

No! The free Basic Edition of Simply Schedule Appointments allows you to create an unlimited number of Appointment Types so that you can create a booking calendar for each of your business' services.

And the booking plugin will never limit the number of appointments that you can book.

= Can I test the Simply Schedule Appointments booking calendars before installation? =

Yes, we have a [variety of booking demos](https://simplyscheduleappointments.com/demos/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=demos) where you can book test appointments.

= How does Simply Schedule Appointments compare to Calendly? =

We bring all of the great features that people are familiar with in the Calendly scheduling tool. But with the versatility and freedom that WordPress offers.

Compared to Calendly, customers who use Simply Schedule Appointments find that this plugin offers:
* A better range of styling options to match your website
